# Title (replace with your title)

Regular expressions, known as Regex, is code that contains a series of special characters used to define a search pattern. At first regex may seem confusing and complicated, but when broken down into simple sections, regex becomes much more easy to understand. That is what I will be doing in this tutorial with a line of regex used to match an email.

## Summary
